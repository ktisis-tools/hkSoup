hkSoup is an open-source toolkit for developing custom FFXIV skeletons built in collaboration with the [Xande](https://github.com/xivdev/Xande) project for model exports and imports. It allows modders to export character skeletons in order to modify and rig them with new bones, which can then be imported back into the game.

**This tooling is still work-in-progress and far from being usable in practice.**
